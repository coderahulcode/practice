Through our activities, Amdocs creates win-win shared values which benefit the community, Amdocs, and Amdocs employees.  For customers, the connected world is a miracle. For service providers, it\'s a planet-sized challenge.  Consumers are overwhelmed by the blizzard of choices in services, devices and price plans. They want simplicity and expect barrier-free communication, anytime, anywhere. The resulting unprecedented demand for data creates enormous challenges in data management and monetization.  But, today\'s insatiable data demand will power tomorrow\'s new revenue sources. And the service providers who realize the full potential of the connected world by developing new business models and selling innovative and revenue generating services are the ones who will continue to win.  We ensure service provider success by embracing their biggest challenges. Uniquely, we combine our industry vision, extensive product portfolio, wide range of proven services and deep industry expertise. Our offerings span BSS, OSS and network control domains in addition to service delivery platforms, or what we call \'customer experience systems\'. With Amdocs, you simplify the customer experience, harness the data explosion and stay ahead, while improving operational efficiency.  Our vision of the connected world   Experts predict that trillions of devices will be connected to the network over the next decade, introducing a dizzying array of services, connections and experiences which will encompass every aspect of our lives.  Customers already have access to the richness of the Web at their fingertips, opening up billions of apps, devices, services, plans and websites. But for the service provider, there are still new industry frontiers to overcome.  Customers are overwhelmed by the choices of this complex multi-choice era, which is the first frontier. And while they might want rich, valuable offers tailored to meet their specific needs and preferences, they also want (and need) help in identifying the right offer from this blizzard of choice, and experiencing consistent simple interactions across touch points. This means turning the customer experience into \"my\" experience - with high quality, simple and personal end-to-end experiences.  A second frontier is the network facing frontier, where service providers are experiencing insatiable demand for data. However, service provider investment in technology just to keep pace with this demand isn\'t something that is sustainable in the long term.  These two frontiers are also opportunities:  The first gives service providers the opportunity to clear away the blizzard and become the customers\' trusted provider for their connected lives. The second frontier poses a fundamental economic opportunity for any business - monetizing a growing demand.  Capturing these opportunities requires service providers to redefine their experience plays:  The first experience play centers on owning the customer experience, in which service providers can partner with over-the-top and other third-party partners, and use their customer data to offer customers an aggregated simple and personal customer experience across devices.  The other experience play is about enablement through a reliable superior network experience, where the service provider utilizes its core assets to enable others to deliver the customer experience.'),(4,3,'+91(124) 3048689','Gurgaon, India (20 minutes from Delhi international airport) 8 and 9, Sector 18, Electronic City, Udyog Vihar, Gurgaon - 122015, India','Nagarro specializes in high-quality business-critical software and IT projects for major corporations.

Boldness In the sense of an entrepreneurship and desire to take considered risks balanced by prudence and clear-sightedness, without which a bold manager can become reckless. Trust It implies a willingness to empower employees and teams, and to allow managers to experience the effects of their initiatives and decisions. Trust also implies an open mind and genuine transparency in the flow of information, and is at the heart of our Collaborative Business ExperienceÂ®. Freedom It includes creativity, innovation, independence of mind and respect for others in their diverse cultures, habits, and customs, all of which are crucial for a company with a presence in 40 countries and that has over 100 nationalities among its employees. Team spirit With clients, employees, and partners; the ability to share in both good and bad times. Modesty In relations with others and in our approach to issues. Fun Without which any corporate vision is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to implement. Weâ??ve created a formal code of ethics to clarify and promote these practices.
