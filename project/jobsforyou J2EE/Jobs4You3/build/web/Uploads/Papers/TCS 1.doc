It consists of around 2.5 to 3 lakh questions probably of a finite set of models. Thus the data may change but the models will be same.<br><br>SO, my sincere advice is: refer the TCS old papers from this site during your preparation.<br>And also from tcs.csestrikers  <br>It will help you a lot.<br><br>I could not remember the questions exactly but I assure you the model is the same.<br>Note: All the questions in the actual test will be preceded by lot of unnecessary data to confuse you.<br>I am posting only the main part of each problem<br><br>Q.1<br><br>There are two water tanks A and B, A is much smaller than B. While water fills at the rate of 1 liter every hour in A, it gets filled up like, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160 in tank B. (At the end of first hour, B has 10 liters, second hour it has 20 liters and so on). If tank B is 1/32 filled of the 21 hours, what is total duration of hours required to fill it completely?<br>a) 26 B)25 c)5 d)27<br><br>Solution: for every hour water in tank in B is doubled,<br>Let the duration to fill the tank B is x hours.<br>X/32 part of water in tank of B is filled in 21 hours,<br>Next hour it is doubled so,<br>2*(x/32) part i.e (x/16) part is filled in 22 hours,<br>Similarly (x/8) th part in 23 hours,(x/4)th part is filled in 24 hours,<br>(x/2) th part is filled in 25 hours, (x) th part is filled in 26 hours<br>So answer is 26 hours.<br><br>Q.2<br>6 persons standing in queue with different age group, after two years their average age will be 43 and seventh person joined with them. Hence the current average age has become 45. Find the age of seventh person?<br>a) 43 b) 69 c) 52 d) 31<br><br>solution<br>Total age of 6 persons is x hours,after two years total age of 6 persons is x+12<br>Average age of 6 persons is after two years is 43<br>So (x+12)/6=43,then solve x,<br>After 7th person is added then (x+7th person age)/7=45<br>So we will get 7th person age easily<br><br>Q.3<br>A man travels from A to B at 4 mph over a certain journey and returns over the same route to A, at 5 mph. What is his average speed for the journey?<br><br>Solution: Average speed=(2*x*y)/(x+y)<br><br>Q.4<br>A toy train produces 10 different sounds when it moves around a circular toy track of radius 5 m at 10 m per min. However, the toy train is defective and it now produces only 2 different tunes at random. What are the odds that the train produces for consecutive music tones of the same type?<br>a) 1 in 16 B) 1 in 4 c) 1 in 8 d) 1 in 32<br><br>Solution: Initially it produces 10 sounds and the defect came and now it produces only 2 different sounds and consecutively so there are totally 2 sounds and we have to select on sound and the probability is ½ and it produces the same sound concecutively for 2 times so the probability becomes ½*1/2 ie ¼<br><br><br>Q.5<br>A scientist was researching on animal behavior in his lab. He was very interested in analyzing the behavior of bear. For some reason he travelled 1mile in north direction & reached at North Pole. There he saw a bear.

Difference between weights of A and B is 3 kgs. And between B and C is 5 kgs. Then what is the maximum sum of the differences of all possible combinations when two boxes are taken each time<br>Sol: A-B = 3<br>B-c = 5<br>A-c = 8 so sum of diff = 8+3+5 = 16 kgs<br><br>88) A and B are shooters and having their exam. A and B fall short of 10 and 2 shots respectively to the qualifying mark. If each of them fired at least one shot and even by adding their total score together, they fall short of the qualifying mark, what is the qualifying mark?<br>Sol: Because each had at least 1 shot done so 10 + 1 = 11<br>And 9 + 2 = 11<br>So the ans is 11<br><br>89) A, B, C, and D tells the following times by looking at their watches. A tells it is 3 to 12. B tells it is 3 past 12. C tells it is 12:2. D tells it is half a dozen too soon to 12. No two watches show the same time. The difference between the watches is 2,3,4,5 respectively. Whose watch shows maximum time?<br>Sol: A shows 11:57, B shows 12:03, C shows 12:02 and D shows 11:06 therefore,<br>Max time is for B<br><br>90) Falling height is proportional to square of the time. One object falls 64cm in 2sec than in 6sec from how much height the object will fall.<br>Sol: The falling height is proportional to the square of the time.<br>Now, the falling height is 64cm at 2sec<br>So, the proportional constant is=64/ (2*2) =16;<br>So, at 6sec the object fall maximum (16*6*6) cm=576cm;<br>Now, the object may be situated at any where.<br>If it is>576 only that time the object falling 576cm within 6sec .Otherwise if it is situated<576 then it fall only that height at 6sec.<br><br>91) Last year pandit was thrice his sister,s age.

First of all through online registration students should get registered for the written test .Don,t bother about this your placement officer will inform about this. The interview consists of 4 rounds <br><br>1)Written Test (Online) <br>Verbal part : 10 synonyms 10 antonyms 1 reading comprehension with 4 questions 6 fill in the blanks with appropriate sentences. <br>Quant (30 questions) Critical Reasoning (12 marks 3 reasoning paragraphs) <br>2) Technical Round ( Majority Elimination Round) <br>3) Management Round (Elimination Round) <br>4) HR Interview ( Not an elimination round) <br><br>Now follow my the above suggesitions These suggestions are not for the students who have prepared well from months these are for the students who are worried about how to clear the tcs written test with no preparation until now .. For clearing the written test u should follow barrons 12th edition don,t worry its not necessary to read the entire book.I will tell you which parts u should cover For Quant questions: Just practice the questions present in all 2008 posts it is more than sufficient no need of doing rs agarwal ..all 30 out of 30 questions will come from the freshers world first 25 tcs posts only just data will change . <br><br>For antonyms : There are around 180 antonyms in barrons which u should compulsory byhatt them .around 8 to 9 sometimes even 10 out of 10 antonyms will come from these 180 antonyms. After you are confident with these 180 antonyms then only go for other stuff ok.. Barrons 12th edition page no 122 to 129 here there are 100 antonyms out of 180 ..remaining around 80 antonyms are from the 5 model papers at the end of book . Don,t take it silly just go through it..in the test if u had kept 10 out of 10 antonyms then u will get lot of confidence..practise these 180 a lot and lot. For Reading Comprehension: Just go through the reading comprehension in the 5 model test papers .<br>Don,t leave the paragraphs with 6 questions see them also. If you have 1 or 2 days time don,t waste time by doing the paragraphs on your own .90 % they will give the paragraph from barrons only. So for each paragraph sit with your friends .For a paragraph write down the answers at one place and just form a simple story on these answers.This is the most effective way to remember the answers without headache. For Rc,s don,t take the risk of byhatting the options .They may change the sequence some times. Ok do u feel some what relaxed because the headache of rc,s and antonyms had gone . For synonyms: First of all read all the synonyms from the 5 model papers .Then go for high frequency word list. U can answer around 5 to 6 . I don,t know from where u can get the remaining synonyms. Sentence Completion: Don,t be in a illusion that a sentence will come n u should identify the appropriate word.This is the toughest part in the verbal section .They will give a paragraph with 6 blanks . U should identify the missing sentences not the missing words . Identify the appropriate sentence . go for this section only at the end of the test.Maximum , time wouldn,t be there to do this section.Even u have not scored much don,t bother u can do well in other sections. Critical Reasoning: This is my favourite section. With in a short time u will know why I called it as my favourite section. <br><br>This is the most easiest section for some guys because some people may get all the reasoning paragraphs from barrons.and for some they may not get even single pargraph like me ( I am the most unlucky person) . But the paragraphs which are not from barrons will be easy to do.. I have done around 10 questions easily. If u have time to do the reasoning paragraphs then practice them from barrons model papers before the exam. But if didn,t have time to practice the reasoning section and if you dare to leave them don,t do so. I will tell u how to byhatt them . maximum 99.9 % they will give the reasoning paragraphs from the barrons model papers as it is , without changing the order so just byhatt them. This is the way I have byhatted the reasoning paragraphs from barrons model papers. They are around 25 reasoning paragraphs with 4 questions leave the reasoning paras with 6 questions . <br>These are some telugu sentences only Andhra students can understand to byhatt the reasoning paragraphs. Concentrate on highlighted word Non Andhra students just skip this section and read the other suggesitions. <br><br>1) If any word like motorist appeared in the reasoning paragraph .then remember this short story : Motorist (motor cycle naduputhunna vaadu ) addamga (From this remind AD) velli company CEO ( Ceo numchi CE gurthupettukovali) ne guddisardu so answer is : ADCE u can form the stories of your own like this to remember .this is the way I byhatted them. <br>2)if the words marriage in the society appears in the paragraph then story is Pelli kuthurni ne cab lo ante pallaki lo (From this CAB) lo mosukuntu dum dum dum ani (From this D) thesukuvelthunnaru. So answer is : CABD <br>3) if the word Pentagon appears in the paragraph then story is Us lo pentagon meda attack jariginappude pakkane idea cell tower vundatanta appudu adi kuda padi poyindanta attack lo .eppudu cell lo c thesi idea lo i place lo pettandi cdea vasthundi So answer is :CDEA <br>4) if the word Latin,Sanskrit appears in the paragraph then story is Dady (from this DAD) Sanskrit, latin nerchukomani books (From this remind B) thesukuvacharu So answer is: DADB <br>5) if the word Baseball players appears in the paragraph then story is Base ball player addamga (From this AD) beer ( from this BE) thagesi ishtamvachinattu aaduthunnaru So answer is: ADBE <br>6) if the word Novels appears in the paragraph then story is popular novels anni kuda bead meda (from this bead) podukuni chaduvutham kada so the answer is :BEAD <br>7) if the word Delegations appears in the paragraph then story is Delegates vachinappudu ammayalu (from this remind A) boquets echi vallaki welcome chepthu ECE department(From this ECE) ki thesukuni vellaru So answer is : AECE<br>8) if the word Formal Dinner appears in the paragraph then story is dinner lo mulakaada (drum stick from this CADA) vaddincharu So answer is : CADA <br>9) if the word Visa appears in the paragraph then story is Visa vachindi so us velladu . us velli a to e anni chusesi ( place A first and E last) Madhya madhalo cinemalu ,appudappudu college ke vellevadu(so remind CC in the middle) . so answer is : ACCE <br>10) if in the paragraph either museum or eight caves appears answer is :CCBB( c square b square) museuem or eight caves ccbb(c square b square) <br>11) if in the paragraph either memorial day appears Answer is: ccba ( c square b a) <br>Horizontal row,vertical row answer:ccac(c square a c) <br>Basket ball dccb(d c square b) <br>Democratic conservative party ddbc(d square b c) <br>Hotel Miramar dbca Story for this is in dhaba (from this DB) cat walk(from this CA) is going on so answer is DBCA.<br>Three worker each day aede <br>Six school board members dbde <br>Official hoster of newyork city eade<br>A is the father of two children deeb (d e square b) <br>A,b,c,d,e ,f,q edbc <br>A,b,c,w,d,e,x,f aabc ( a sqaure b c) <br>After cracking the written they will give u a 3 page application form be very careful with it ..don,t struck any column , fill it without any strikeoff...it is damn important Don,t fill the application form in hurry. One of my friend he filled the application form by referring to another frnds appli form he in hurry put the dob of other person n striked in the appli form had rewritten.<br>After going to HR round i.e 4th round HR rejected due to this silly mistake they consider these sort of mistakes as irresponsible,negligence and arrogance. And one of other friend he forgot to write the place name at place column. He got rejected at the end of second day ..so silly mistakes may end ur interview be very very careful.. Don,t put the neck button without wearing a tie..in personal skills don,t write meaning less sentences like I am optimistic,object oriented mind setup these sort of dirty sentences..ur resume should be as simple as possible.. <br>Now Technical Round: Always remember no HR or any person they not even see ur file or certificates u got .they wont even touch them.

He didn,t ask me how did u do the project tell me he asked the questions based on his knowledge . I couldn,t answer them .He asked me tell me how did u done data base configuration in apache tomcat server I have never touched it infact we do nothing like that . its my fate .. all CS N IT STUDENTS be thorough with these questions write logic for implementins Palindrome Swapping of two variables without using temp variables Fibonicci series with n without recursion <br><br>Factorial with n without recursion <br><br>Pascal triangle, Hi friends this is chaitu from srkr engineering college,bhimavaram.recently TCS came to our college on may 9th and 10th of this month .Around 430 members have appeared for the written test and nearly 230 members got cleared their written test and 91 members finally selected for TCS . <br>Friends just follow my suggesitions u can easily crack the TCS interview .really don,t take my words silly.Even though I have not selected for tcs I can tell better than others because I have lost it..u shouldn,t loose it by doing silly mistakes..

After that two paragraphs are given in that section. Totally 32 marks in this section. Concentrate  little in this part because this is some what difficult to answer depend much on luck. <br><br>b) Arithmetic ability: <br>This is the easiest section where we can get good score. It is enough to prepare previous papers, they just change the digits and the model is same. There are some problems from Bar and Pie Chart. If u score above 32 out of 38, I m damm sure that u will clear the written. <br><br>Few were like. <br><br>1.    58, 27, 12, __, 2 .<br>Sol. 27*2+4 = 58,    12*2+3 = 27,  5*2+2 = 12,  2*2+1 = 5,  1*2+0 = 2 .ans = 5 <br><br>2. How the given string how many Ys are followed by L that are not followed by PYLYPQMYLPMLYLLYQMYYLQYLPLYAMLYLM Sol. Only count those pair by YL and discard pairs of YLP      ..ans =4. <br><br>3. First & second, third and fourth, fifth and sixth letter of word SENSATIONALY are   interchanged find the 12th letter form right.<br>Sol.  The interchanged word is ESSNTAIONALY. Now start counting frm Right the 12th letter is E. <br><br>4. What is the largest prime number which can be stored in 6 bit register?<br>Sol.  As the register is 6 bit long we can store max number 63 (if all bits are 1).But 63 is not prime the  largest  prime number is 61.                       <br>Ans = 61. <br><br>5)     Number of faces, vertices and edges of a cube<br>Ans.   6, 8, 12 <br><br>6. If g(0) = 1, g(1) = -1 and g(n) = g(n-1)-g(n-2) then calculate g(6).<br>Sol. Start with g(2) = g(1) + g(0) = -1 - 1 = -2,  g(3) = g(2) + g(1) = -2+1 = -1,  g(4) = g(3) + g(2) =  -1+1 = 0,  g(5) = g(4) + g(3) = 0+1 = 1,  g(6) = g(5) + g(4) = 1-0 = 1      <br> ans = 1. <br><br>7. which of the following heaving highest  standard deviation.<br>a. 9,0,9,0,9,0          b. 9,-9,0,9,0,-9   c. 9,-9,9,-9,9,-9    d. 9,9,9,9,9,9<br>Ans.  C, standard deviation is 18(i.e. the difference between two consecutive terms is highest). <br><br>8.   Find the result of the following expression- M (737, 7) +R (3.4) +T (7. 7)-R (6.4) if, M denotes modules operation, R denotes round-off, T denotes truncations?<br>Sol): 2+3+7-6 = 6 <br><br>9. In a city, temperature at noon varies according to -t^2/6 + 4t + 12, where t is elapsed time. Find the percentage change in temperature from 3pm. to 6 pm.<br>Sol): In equation first put t=3,<br>we will get 25.5........................... (1)<br>Now put t=6,<br>we will get 42.............................. (2)<br>So %change = ((42-25.5)/42)*100) <br>=39.3 <br><br>10.  Find d Odd one out?   a. Oracle b. Linux c. Ingress d. DB2<br>Ans.  All other except Linux which is an operating system are Database Management Systems. <br><br>Etc   <br><br>C) Critical Reasoning: <br>In this section there will be 3 passages and questions on it. So, we have to prepare the GRE Barrons book either 12th or 13th edition. All will come from that only. <br><br>  <br><br>Out of 250 students, 150 cleared written test.

Go through all the reasoning ques. IGNORE THEM AT YOUR OWN PERIL! Some important passages are:<br>Model test 1: Section5 - qns 1-4 (motorist), qns 13-16 (red and brown)  Section6 - qns 1-4 (conservative,democratic), qns 8-11 (latin, sanskrit), qns 12-18 (joe,larry,ned), qns    19-22 (a causes b) <br>Model test 2: Section1 - qns 19-22 (wallachia and rumelia) ---i got this qn, but the names were changed as london and paris , and a,b,c etc were changed as french, italian etc.Section6 - qns 8-12 ( ashland , liverpool), qns 13-16 (spelunker) ---i got this qn, qns 17-22 (pesth) ---i got this one too  <br>Model test 3: Section6 - qns 1-4 (all Gs are Hs)<br>Model test 4: Section5 - qns 8-11 (horizontal row), qns 19-22 (a,b,c cause d) Section6 - qns 8-12 (spanish, italian), qns 13-16 (all As, Bs), qns 17-22 (progressive federal party)  <br>Model test 5: Section3 - qns8-11 (museum), qns 19-22 (A is the father) Section7- qns 1-5 (prahtu, brahtu), qns 21-25 (scurvy)   <br><br>  <br><br>INTERVIEW-  <br>We had just 1 combined tech and HR interview. You might have 2 rounds. For tech interview my sincere advice is that BE THOROUGH WITH YOUR BRANCH SUBJECTS! Out of the 4 computer subjects(c, c++, ds and rdbms) prepare any one thoroughly and atleast the basics of other 3.<br><br>  <br><br>For HR interview prepare some general ques like:<br>1. Tell me about yourself<br>2. Strength and weakness<br>3. Why TCS<br>4. Why IT (for non-stream students)<br>5. Where you see yourself after 5 years<br>6. Hobbies and interests<br>7. Your idol and why<br><br>  <br><br>INTERVIEW TIPS-   <br><br>1. Dress properly<br><br>2. ALWAYS have a smile on your face<br><br>3. Be confident and enthusiastic<br><br>4. ALWAYS be polite and humble<br><br>5. NEVER bluff. If you dont know something tell them politely<br><br>6. ALWAYS try to lead the interview<br><br>7. During tech interview, ALWAYS explain them the concept. This will also show them your communication skill.<br><br>8. NEVER EVER argue with the interviewer<br><br><br><br><hr><p><font color="##FF0000">Following paper is provided by YuvaJobs.com .

It has stores great quantities of knowledge; it teaches more people; and despite its failures, it teaches them better.__D___ . Of the great branches of knowledge- the sciences the  social sciences and humanities- the science are applied. Strenuous and occasionally successful efforts are  made to apply the social sciences, not almost never are the humanities well applied. We do not use philosophy in defining our conduct. __E__. The great task of the university in the next generation is to learn to use the  knowledge we have for the questions that come before us. __F___ The difference between a primary problem<br> and a secondary or even tertiary problem is that primary problems tend to be around for a long time, whereas<br>the less important ones get solved.<br><br>One primary problem is that of interfering with biological development. ___A____. Obviously, there are benefits  both to individuals and to society from eliminating, or at least improving, mentally and physically deformed persons.  On the other hand, there could be very serious consequences if this knowledge were used with premeditation to  produce superior and subordinate classes, each genetically prepared to carry out a predetermined  mission. __B___, Here we have a primary problem that will still exist when we are all dead. Of course, the  traditional faculty members would say. __C____. And certainly they would not learn, but they would learn some other things.<br><br>A.    The next generation, and perhaps this one, will be able to interfere chemically with the actual development of an individual and perhaps biologically by interfering with an individuals genes.<br>B.    This can be done, but what happens to free will and he rights of the individual<br>C.    But the students wont learn enough to go to graduate school<br>D.    It is in the application of this knowledge that the failure has come.<br>E.    We do not use literature as a source of real and vicarious experience.<br>F.    The university should organize should organize courses around primary problems<br>G.    The universities greatest shortcoming is not to help students see the relevance of humanities to real problems.<br>H.    It is difficult for modern students, accustomed to the minute of film, to appreciate opera.<br>I.    It is necessary students to require to  include in their curricula liberal arts courses.<br><br>About aptitude, i wud just say no need 2 worry as it is the most easiest section,just practice papers of last 2 or 3 years and u will be able to solve all of them on the day of test.<br><br>some ques were as follows:--<br>Q1.

There was no sectional cut off, no upper cut off, but what i felt was that for critical reasoning u must have to do at least one passage consisting of 4 questions correctly .  <br><br>WRITTEN TEST:<br>It was an online test which consisted of three sections: 1) Verbal. 2) Quantitative Aptitude. 3) Critical Reasoning. VERBAL SECTION: It consisted of 10 antonyms, 10 synonyms and two passage in which you have to fill in the blanks with correct sentences. For antonyms do only the 5 model test papers & for synonyms prepare the exercises in the high freq. word list. Though I got only 4 antonyms & 2 synonyms in the paper but it is enough & rest of all I marked option c. For passage the time left was very less. Its a bit difficult but dont worry, u can get through even if u don know anything in verbal. Refer barrons 12th edition only.  <br><br>QUANTITATIVE APTITUDE:<br>It consisted of 38 questions 40 mins. Very easy. All previous year questions were repeated. Sometimes they dont even change the data. I will suggest that go through all d previous yrs papers.Some questions which I remember are given below:<br>1. Exact power of 2?<br>Ans: 4096 , Hint: 2^10=1024,2^12=1024*4=4096. <br><br>2 Find the result of the following expression if, M denotes modulus operation, R denotes round-off, T denotes truncation: M(373,5)+R(3.4)+T(7.7)+R(5.8)<br>Ans: 19 <br><br>3.

It was for 30 mins. All the questions were from 12 edition Barrons . They don even change the data and the order of questions. They just cut copy paste from BARRONS 12 EDITION. Since it was online test for us so everyone had different set of questions. For this section I would suggest that do all the analytical passages, having 4 or more questions, from the 5 model test papers of Barrons 12th edition. if u r not able to understand then just learn or mug up the answers. The passages that I got were:<br>1. First question was red and brown marriage group<br>2. Second was hotel Miramar.<br>3. Third was the Prahtu & Brahtu.  <br><br>TECHNICAL AND HR INTERVIEW:<br> I had the technical & hr interview on the next day, in the afternoon just after lunch. My first question was tell about ur self. I m from ECE branch & since I havent mentioned any subject of interest so they started asking the basics of electronics.Like diode,rectifier(half wave,full wave,center tapped,bridge rectifier etc.),characteristics of diode,zener diode,avalanche breakdown, BJT, FET, uses of pnp transistor, configurations(common base, CE, CC), gain factor â etc.. Then he started asking from digital elex like multiplexer, demux, decoder, flip flops(types, logic diagram, etc..) , thyristors from power elex,some quest were from communications.. then he asked the basics of c++ & asked me to write a program for finding largest of 3 nos. comparing a no. not more than twice, in one line. <br><br>Hint: a>b?(a>c?a:c):(b>c?b:c) <br><br>Then they asked general questions like: Why tcs? u r from elex background then why IT sector? etc Please remember whether u r a IT or a non IT student they expect u to have some basic idea about c or c++. He gave me some situations asked that what will u do in that situation..plz keep in mind that even if u dont know the answer just give a cute smile & be confident. <br><br>I thought that my tech & hr were combined but after some time I got a call for hr . there he asked the similar questions like tell abt ur self, why tcs,etc..then he asked about my father what he do & family backgroundthen he asked about the TATA crucible ( a quiz) that I mentioned in my cvasked my hobbies & asked that what I think on India Vs Australia controversies.DO prepare basic information about tcs.(especially its vision mission n valuesits CEO,chairman.  panys status.recent news about comPANY.etc & listen the pre placement talk carefully). Finally they asked me do u want 2 ask anything?......so DO prepare some qs 4 this.What I asked was that :what I m lacking & what u expect me to do to improve it , since I have still 1 yr to spend at the college b4 joining, so it can benefit me as well as the company. He smiled & answered. <br><br>My friends & my seniors helped me a lot.i thanx to all of them..the main thing is that just be confident and have a smile on your face. That is the secret to get through TCS. In the night the results were declared & I was one among the students to be selected. <br><br><br><br><hr><p><font color="##FF0000">Following paper is provided by YuvaJobs.com .

This is Ashutosh Kumar Singh (B.Tech 3rd year CS ). TCS conducted a recruitment Drive in my college (V.I.E.T , Ghzbd) on 9th March 2008 (for three days ). I cleared the written exam (online) . For written exam , just go through the previous papers & Barrons 12 Edition . This will be sufficient . But, b careful not to press d Exit button . Itll lock ur answers .<br>Interview was a three round process .<br> Technical Round .<br> HR Round .<br> Mangerial Round .<br><br>Technical Round :<br>Firstly ,I entered the room for the technical interview .<br>I said May I come in Sir .<br>He said Come in .<br>I said Good Morning to both the interviewers (actually 1 was male & another female).<br>I said May I sit They said Sure .<br>The first question for me is Tell me about yourself .<br>Told .<br>Then they immediately shifted there focus to technical part . They read ( in my CV ) about my first Project .<br> He asked Whts platform for dis.<br> I said Java Sir .<br>He said You know Java .<br>I said only Core Java .<br>He asked What is Multithreaded ? . Told . ( Upto 5 mins he asked questions related to Multithreading , I gave answer to all questions ) .<br>He asked Wht is Inheritance ? . Told .<br>He asked Is dere any concept of Multiple Inheritance ? .<br>I said No .<br>He asked Then How can we achieve Multiple Inheritance ?.<br> I said We can use Interfaces. He asked few questions on Interfaces .<br>He asked about RDBMS . (My favourite ). I told everything about RDBMS .<br>He asked Wht is DDL & DML ?.<br>Told .<br>They both asked a lot questions on RDBMS & answered all of them .<br>Finally the lady questioned Do u know JDBC ?<br>I said Yes ! I used JDBC in my project .<br>Then She said Can u just write the code to connect Java with any Database ?.<br>I wrote the whole code for connection . And then I came out of the room .<br><br>HR Round :<br>After 5 mins or so ,I got a call for Hr interview .<br> I entered the room May I come in MAM ? . There were two sweet females .<br>I said Good morning Mam .<br>They said Good morning .<br>They said Tell me about yourself which is not mentioned in ur CV.<br>I said My hobbies r  , My strengths are , My weakness are  . In d weakness section I said Due to dedicated work my social Life gets affected .<br>She said Ashutosh ! U r very smart . She repeated this sentence thrice .<br>But I repeatedly said Mam whether u believe it or not its a fact . I even mentioned some of my instances where I actually suffered due to work .<br>She said  Why TCS ? . Told .<br>She said If we place u somewhere like Trivandaram ?<br>I said No problem ! Mam.<br>She told me about the Bond of Rs. 50000 , that if Ill leave TCS b4 2 years ,then Ill have to pay this much of amount . R u comfortable with the amount ?<br>. I said Ill not leave TCS for my whole life .So, I dont have to worry about this amount<br>After few more questions , I got out of the room .<br><br>MR round (Next Day) :<br>I entered the room saying  May I come in Sir . This time there was only 1 single guy . He seems to b a very experienced man .<br>He said Come in .<br>He said Tell me about yourself , Explain both ur projects (2) . This time only ull speak & Ill listen .<br>I started off & ended up explaining my both two projects .<br>He asked few questions on my project ( especially from the second project ) .<br>Then he asked me some general questions .At last he asked me to solve 1 puzzle "There r 9 points & I was supposed to join dese points with only 4 lines " .<br>I did this .<br>Then he again gave another puzzle ,which was a bit tough for me . I wasn,t able to solve dis 1 .<br>It,s like if u dont answer or able to crack dese baffles ,u dont need to b worry ,coz dese things hardly matters . But ,If u,ll solve dem ,it,ll b an added advantage for u . Otherwise ,I think dat only d Technical interview is important .<br>It,s like 70% - Tech interview , 20% - Hr Interview & 10 % - Mr Interview .<br><br><br><br><br><hr><p><font color="##FF0000">Following paper is provided by YuvaJobs.com .

And not to mention I was one of the lot. Thanks to all the papers uploaded on this site by numerous people .I am not uploading my written test paper because all the questions were same .But u must be cautious while reading as they have changed the values .They have prepared a same set of questions with values changed and the same questions are being given all over india.So my suggestion for the written are simple. Just solve 2-3 papers uploaded  on this site  and i believe  u will be through  the written test. For  L.R section  just go through barron,s 12th edition  .Same for the comprehension<br><br>Now comes the P.I. part. Luckily I had H.R and tech combined .In case u don,t no need to worry ..Just go through the basics of whatever fav subjects u r going to mention.U never no which panel u would get. In some panel they would only H.R and in some other only Tech. So it all depends.They may not ask u form ur fav subjects and at the same time they may ask about NEWTON,s laws of motion, gauss law ,faraday law etc.So u see u need to know abt the basics and some indepth knowledge  abt ur fav. subjects.It may happen that they may not ask for for ur subjects.It depends.....<br>So I am only going to tell u abt my interview experience I gave my P.I to a lady and don,t take her for granted ....<br><br>Lady:: so tell me abt urself which is not  mentioned in ur resume.<br>me:: told abt my hostel life<br>Lady:: so what is the best part of hostel life?<br>me:: told something abt unity,to adapt<br>Lady: :if someone does a wrong thing( in a workplace) what would u do<br>me:: told<br>lady:: draw the architecture of 8085 mp<br>me:: did and explained too(u should)<br>lady: diff between c nd c++<br>me:: told<br>lady:: diff between linux and windows( i had done a project on linux)<br>me: :told<br>lady:: some more questions abt my project<br>lady:: name first 10 elements of periodic table(where did this come from)<br>me: could tell only first five but told sorry<br>lady:: tell me newton,s first law and 2nd law<br>me: :told both<br>lady:: who is the CEO of TCS<br>me:: mr s rama dorai<br>lady:: what do u know abt TCS<br>me:: told what i had gathered frm  net(u must listen at the presentation)<br>lady::: some questions on hobbies what do u generally blog abt<br>me: :told<br>lady:: are u on orkut<br>me:: yes mam<br>lady:: how many hrs do u spent on orkut<br>me:: defended myself by saying that i visit only when any notification abt new scraps come into my mail<br>lady:: seems satisfied<br>lady:: u can ask any question<br>me :: asked abt recession<br>end of the interview <br><br><br><br><hr><p><font color="##FF0000">Following paper is provided by YuvaJobs.com .

Bhubaneswar - 15  March  2008  </h3><br><br>TCS PAPER ON 15th MARCH AT BHUBANESWAR<br><br>Hello Frendz !! I am Omkar Dash from CVRCE (I.T), Bhubaneswar. I was one of the lucky 130 students who got through campus recruitment procedure of TCS with success.<br><br>This is just to provide you an insight into what sort of qns can be asked in TCS interview . My friend Mukul from electrical branch had already uploaded the complete test paper of qubex(TCS testing software is called qubex).The online exam was held on 14.03.08 followed by pi on 15.03.08 and the results were declared on 00:02 hrs of 16.03.08<br><br>The PI  was TECH+HR  at a time. There were 15 panels each containing 2 people. Interviewers were reasonably cool but that dint promise good times to many during interviews. What i summed up from the interview was that the Pi round was totally attitude-centered. What they checked was attitude. And i have sound reasons to say so. Many people who were very good in tech dint qualify because the only lacunae they could have possibly have was lack of positive attitude and confidence.Well, communication skills were fine enough for many.   <br><br>Let me now give a gist of my interview. Mine was the last interview of panel 5 in Slot 3 and it was basically a stress interview. It lasted for 35+ minutes and i was asked about all topics except C, C++, Data Structure, RDBMS, OS, or Computer Networks. (These were my core papers as my branch is IT). Now one would wonder what was asked. Well, I had a well tailored CV and even the HR made a great remark on my CV as one of the best CVs that I have seen in recent times . But that remark was the sole cause of the stress I was put into. In my CV, I had 6 bulleted points of Awards and Achievements out of which 3 were first prizes in Paper presentations (Human Area networking, Deep Web, Web 2.0).<br><br>My interview went like this:<br>(Member 1 : Tech- Male, member 2: HR-Female. I, accompanied by volunteer entered the interview room. Wished them. I was offered a seat)<br>Mem1: So Omkar, nice name.<br>Mem2: Tell us what do you do daily? (I never expected this; all my friends were asked tell me about yourself. So paused for a while and then begun with confidence)<br>Me: I make my today better than my yesterday and strive for a better tomorrow!!  I am eager for improving myself both personally and professionally. I try to be a better person with every passing day.<br>Mem2: Witty answer Omkar, but one could possibly infer that you are a bad person and just trying to be good.<br>Me: Mam, I think there always a scope for improving ourselves.<br>Mem1: Okay tell what all technical knowledge you have.<br>Me: Sir I know C, C++, Data Structures, and RDBMS.<br>Mem2 :( cutting me short) what else?<br>Me: OS, CN<br>Mem1: But we expect you to know something else, something more?<br>Me: Sir I know basics of HTML, JavaScript and CSS.<br>Mem2: What is normalization?<br>(I was about to begin but I was cut short again)<br>Mem1: What is DKNF? (again cut short)<br>Mem1: What is a OORDMS?<br>Me: Sir, OORDBMS is Object Oriented DBMS.<br>Mem1: Okay tell me what two tier architecture is.<br>Me: I answered. e.g.: Client Server Architecture.<br>Mem1: Now, take is paper and explain me three tier architecture.<br>Me: Tried to explain. (But he interrupted)<br>Mem1: Ok, Omkar. Many of your friends will ask you what questions we have asked you. Its up to you what you tell them. But let me give you an example of three tier arch. That you should share with everyone sitting outside. (And he explained until he cleared all my doubts)<br>Mem2: Ok Omkar you have a Gmail Id , Tell me what Gmail uses ?<br>Me: AJAX<br>Mem1: What is AJAX?<br>Me: Asynchronous JavaScript and XML?<br>Mem1: What that XML?<br>Me: Sir XML stands for Extensible Markup Language.<br>Mem1: What is the best feature of XML?<br>Me: Sorry Sir.<br>Mem2: You dont know anything.<br>Mem1: Okay explain me your 1st seminar.<br>Me: I explained. (Then I was cross questioned on that)<br>Mem1: What is Web 2.0 omkar? (Web 2.0 was my seminar topic)<br>Me: Explained.<br>Mem2: Is it like a new www replacing the old?<br>Me: No sir, Not exactly, but adding new features to the old one for making it more user friendly.. etc etc<br>Mem1: What is Deep Web?<br>Me: Explained.<br>Mem1: How can you search in deep web?<br>Me: explained<br>Mem1: Ok tell me what an SQL query does?<br>Me: Sir, Its a 4GL language. So it has to be converted into machine readable code for serving its purpose. Then I explained query processor<br>Mem1: Tell me about differences between Google query and SQL query?<br>Me: explained<br>Mem1: You have Data Structure in Syllabus na?<br>Me: Yes Sir.<br>Mem1: Explain me Hashing.<br>Me: Sorry sir. / I dont know.<br>Mem2: Omkar you know all these useless things but you are not clear with basics.<br>Mem1: (To mem2) we are looking for smart guy, isnt it? This guy knows good things but will he sustain in Industry without basics?<br>Mem2: TCS is not the right place for him.<br>Mem1: Ya, You are right.<br>Mem1: Omkar are you clear with basics, your comment on yourself?<br>Me: Sir, you have seen me what I am today. But as I said before I strive for constant improvement. I can guarantee that when I join the company I shall be thorough with basics. And wherever the flaw still existed, the training would clear it off. Because I have heard that TCS training is best in the world.<br>Mem2: Lets see.<br>Mem1: Omkar explain me B+ trees.<br>Me: (started explained correctly and I was interrupted)<br>Mem2: Omkar tell me what is Indexing in Database?<br>Me: (Tried to explain)<br>Mem2: Dint I say you are simply bluffing. You are good for nothing. Why are you wasting your time here?<br>Mem1: I am sure you dont know anything.<br>Me: Sir May be I dont know all these hashing and indexing but I have learnability and I can  learn it in no time. If you could kindly explain me that and ask few questions may be I could answer it.<br>Mem1: So, am I here to teach you?<br>Me: No sir. I just try to make every experience a learning one. So I still request you to explain me<br>Mem1 :( he explained)<br>Mem2: Omkar you seem fat? If you could not maintain you body how can you maintain a project?<br>Me: I am trying to reduce since past three months, and I have already shred away 7 kgs. Given more time, I will definitely shape up myself.<br>(Mem1 drew two tables and asked me to pick up the normalized one and I did so)<br>Mem1: What is paging?<br>Me: explained paging.<br>Mem1: what is an IVT?<br>Me: sir, IVT means Interrupt Vector table<br>Mem2: No. Its not that, you dont know anything. You are just bluffing.<br>Mem1:Ya, you are bluffing..(then he kept on quizzing me for another 5 minutes)   <br><br>Frendz, this interview may not be repeated with anyone. But this was a guideline for answering such type of interviews. I just kept my cool , answered with smile on my face and confidence on my words. And I was through.   <br><br><br><br><hr><p><font color="##FF0000">Following paper is provided by YuvaJobs.com .

Total weight of box is 264kg. How many 2kg packets are there ?<br>Sol) x= 2 kg Packs<br>y= 1 kg packs<br>x + y = 150     .......... Eqn 1<br>2x + y = 264   .......... Eqn 2<br>Solve the Simultaneous equation; x = 114<br>so, y = 36<br>ANS :  Number of 2 kg Packs = 114.<br><br>3) My flight takes of at 2am from a place at 18N 10E and landed 10 Hrs later at a place with coordinates 36N70W. What is the local time when my plane landed?<br>6:00 am b) 6:40am c) 7:40 d) 7:00 e) 8:00<br>Sol) The destination place is 80 degree west to the starting place. Hence the time difference between these two places is 5 hour 20 min. (=24hr*80/360).<br>When the flight landed, the time at the starting place is 12 noon (2 AM + 10 hours).<br>Hence, the time at the destination place is 12 noon - 5:20 hours = 6: 40 AM<br><br>4) A plane moves from 9°N40°E to 9°N40°W. If the plane starts at 10 am and takes 8 hours to reach the destination, find the local arrival time ?<br>Sol) Since it is moving from east to west longitide we need to add both<br>ie,40+40=80<br>multiply the ans by 4<br>=>80*4=320min<br>convert this min to hours ie, 5hrs 20min<br>It takes 8hrs totally . So 8-5hr 20 min=2hr 40min<br>So the ans is 10am+2hr 30 min<br>=>ans is 12:30 it will reach<br><br>5) The size of the bucket is N kb. The bucket fills at the rate of 0.1 kb per millisecond. A programmer sends a program to receiver. There it waits for 10 milliseconds. And response will be back to programmer in 20 milliseconds. How much time the program takes to get a response back to the programmer, after it is sent? Please tell me the answer with explanation. Very urgent.<br>Sol) see it doesn,t matter that wat the time is being taken to fill the bucket.after reaching program it waits there for 10ms and back to the programmer in 20 ms.then total time to get the response is 20ms +10 ms=30ms...it,s so simple....<br><br>6) A file is transferred from one location to another in ,buckets,. The size of the bucket is 10 kilobytes. Each bucket gets filled at the rate of 0.0001 kilobytes per millisecond. The transmission time from sender to receiver is 10 milliseconds per bucket. After the receipt of the bucket the receiver sends an acknowledgement that reaches sender in 100 milliseconds. Assuming no error during transmission, write a formula to calculate the time taken in seconds to successfully complete the transfer of a file of size N kilobytes.<br>(n/1000)*(n/10)*10+(n/100)....as i hv calculated...~~!not 100% sure<br><br>7) A fisherman,s day is rated as good if he catches 9 fishes, fair if 7 fishes and bad if 5 fishes. He catches 53 fishes in a week n had all good, fair n bad days in the week. So how many good, fair n bad days did the fisher man had in the week<br>Ans:4 good, 1 fair n 2 bad days<br>Sol) Go to river catch fish<br>4*9=36<br>7*1=7<br>2*5=10<br>36+7+10=53...<br>take what is given 53<br>good days means --- 9 fishes so 53/9=4(remainder=17)  if u assume 5 then there is no chance for bad days.<br>fair days means ----- 7 fishes so remaining 17 --- 17/7=1(remainder=10) if u assume 2 then there is no chance for bad days.<br>bad days means -------5 fishes so remaining 10---10/5=2days.<br>Ans: 4 good, 1 fair, 2bad. ==== total 7 days.<br>x+y+z=7--------- eq1<br>9*x+7*y+5*z=53 -------eq2<br>multiply eq 1 by 9,<br>9*x+9*y+9*z=35 -------------eq3<br>from eq2 and eq3<br>2*y+4*z=10-----eq4<br>since all x,y and z are integer i sud put a integer value of y such that z sud be integer in eq 4 .....and ther will be two value y=1 or 3 then z = 2 or 1 from eq 4<br>for first  y=1,z=2 then from eq1 x= 4<br>so 9*4+1*7+2*5=53.... satisfied<br>now for second y=3 z=1 then from eq1 x=3<br>so 9*3+3*7+1*5=53 ......satisfied<br>so finally there are two solution of this question<br>(x,y,z)=(4,1,2) and (3,3,1)...<br><br>8) Y catches 5 times more fishes than X.

I was appeared in TCS recruitment process on 8th march 2008 at BBDNITM lko. There were three rounds- written test (online), TI (technical interview) and<br><br>HR round.<br>Basically TCS recruitment process starts with the online exam.<br><br>ROUND 1<br>Online exam pattern:: It basically consist three sections- VERBAL,QUANT APTITUDE and CRITICAl reasoning.There was no sectional cut off. Tcs has fixed cutoff for whole written test it is not based on the high scorers. So as u complete the test ,the result will be displayed immediately and if u r selected then u r eligible for other rounds.<br><br>VERBAl SECTION:<br>:it consists of 10 Antonyms,10 synonyms and abt 10 to 12 ques based on passage reading.<br><br>SYNONYMS:<br>florid<br>mirage<br>furor<br>choleric<br>infirmity<br>pinnacle<br>voracious<br>slump<br>placate<br>expound<br>ANTONYMS:<br>lugubrious<br>retrospection<br>industry<br>mitigate<br>synergy<br>boorish<br>gamely<br>indigenous<br>fascinate<br>prostrate<br><br>(Actually these are the words which I got in my test paper, but I would advise not to waste ur time in learning English first coz no one can get more than two or three words, so dont worry for that just see all the words from previous papers.)<br><br>SECTION -2 (APTITUDE)<br>1) If log 0.317=0.3332 and log 0.318=0.3364 then find log 0.319 ?<br>Sol) log 0.317=0.3332 and log 0.318=0.3364, then log 0.319=log0.318+(log(0.318-0.317)) = 0.3396<br><br>2)My flight takes of at 2am from a place at 18N 10E and landed 10 Hrs later at a place with coordinates 36N70W. What is the local time when my plane landed?<br>6:00 am b) 6:40am c) 7:40 d) 7:00 e) 8:00<br>Sol) The destination place is 80 degree west to the starting place. Hence the time difference between these two places is 5 hour 20 min. (=24hr*80/360). When the flight landed, the time at the starting place is 12 noon (2 AM + 10 hours). Hence, the time at the destination place is 12 noon - 5:20 hours = 6: 40 AM<br><br>3) what,s the answer for that : A, B and C are 8 bit no,s. They are as follows:<br>A -> 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1<br>B -> 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1<br>C -> 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 ( - =minus, u=union)<br>Find ((A - C) u B) =? To find A-C, We will find 2,s compliment of C and them add it with A, That will give us (A-C) 2,s compliment of C=1,s compliment of C+1 =11000101+1=11000110 A-C=11000101+11000110 =10001001<br><br>Now (A-C) U B is .OR. logic operation on (A-C) and B 10001001 .OR . 00110011 The answer is = 10111011,<br>Whose decimal equivalent is 187.<br><br>4) In a two-dimensional array, X (9, 7), with each element occupying 4 bytes of memory, with the address of the first element X (1, 1) is 3000, find the address of X (8, 5)<br>Sol) initial x (1,1) = 3000 u hav to find from x(8,1)so u have x(1,1),x(1,2) ... x(7,7) = so u have totally 7 * 7 = 49 elementsu need to find for x(8,5) ? here we have 5 elements each element have 4 bytes : (49 + 5 -1) * 4 = 212 -----( -1 is to deduct the 1 element ) 3000 + 212 = 3212<br><br>5)The size of a program is N. And the memory occupied by the program is given by M = square root of 100N. If the size of the program is increased by 1% then how much memory now occupied ?<br>Sol) M=sqrt(100N) N is increased by 1% therefore new value of N=N + (N/100) =101N/100<br>M=sqrt(100 * (101N/100) )<br>Hence, we get M=sqrt(101 * N)<br><br>6)In two dimensional array X(7,9) each element occupies 2 bytes of memory.If the address of first element X(1,1)is 1258 then what will be the address of the element X(5,8) ?<br>Sol) Here, the address of first element x[1][1] is 1258 and also 2 byte of memory is given. now, we have to solve the address of element x[5][8], therefore, 1258+ 5*8*2 = 1258+80 = 1338 so the answer is 1338.<br><br>7) The temperature at Mumbai is given by the function: -t2/6+4t+12 where t is the elapsed time since midnight. What is the percentage rise (or fall) in temperature between 5.00PM and 8.00PM?<br><br>8)If g (0)=g (1)=1<br>And g (n)= g (n-1) + g (n 2) find g (6);<br><br>9)Find the physical quantity represented by MOMENTUM *VELOCITY] / [LENGTH * ACCELERATION]?<br><br>10).Which is the largest prime number that can be stored in a 6-bit register?<br><br>11) In a two-dimensional array, X (9, 7), with each element occupying 4 bytes of memory, with the address of the first element X (1, 1) is 3000, find the address of X (8, 5).<br>ANS: 3212<br><br>12)Select the odd one out a.

Mostly its on the same day after one hour.Prepare few of ur subjects very well like C,C++,DS,DBMS(specially queries),OS,COMP Networks,OOPs concepts etc.Hey friends dont be afraid, thay wil not ask u anything in depth they just check ur awareness and ask only some basic conceptual questions. They may ask abt ur fav subjects bt still they ask u abt DBMS n other subjects that u hv studied in earlier sem, so dont tell them the names of the subjects in which u dont hv good command. If u dont know anything abt the ques asked by them then dont try to make false stories or guesses, just simply deny that u dont know, and always try to divert them towards ur fav subjects. They will ask u abt ur project ,if u hv done any, so be prepared for it, its E R diagram, SRS,front end, back end,DFD,and overview of the project etc.Dont BE quiet, be talkative nd dont get embarrassed if u dont know the answer.be confident.i m attaching few most important ques of DBMS,SQL,C,C++ etc for TI , just go through them if u dont hv much time, it will be enough.So u people can download it or if u dont hv it just ask me on my e-mail(yusufkhan_mca@yahoo.co.in).<br><br>ROUND 3: HR ROUND::<br>The key elements for this ROUND according to me are-CCT i.e. be Calm,be Confident(not over confident) and be Talkative. Basically they ask u all those ques that are typically asked in all interviews so be prepared for it ,readymade answers.Normally they check ur confident level, English speaking, and wat efforts u hv done before coming to face HR interview. Just go through the home page of TCS website and collect in formations abt them like::<br><br>Who is chairman, CEO, CFO, COO of TCS, BOARD of directors, Companys MISSION , VISION and VALUES, Target achieved by company during last few yrs, position of company in IT field etc.<br><br>Questions for HR (be prepared for atleast these ques)<br><br>1. Describe yourself??<br>2. ur hobbies(be prepared for this ques coz they will ask u much abt that ,if u say singing be prepare for a song,if u say joking be prepared to tell them a joke etc.)<br>3. Why u want to join TCS??<br>4. Where would u think urself after five years in TCS?<br>5. Why should I hire u??<br>6. they may ask u something abt tcs?its statistics, CEo,CFO etc.<br>7. whats ur fav time pass??<br>8. ur strength ,ur weakness (dont tel them any grt weaknes of urs like if u hv less communication skills, etc)<br>9. Do u have any role model?? Describe his/her achievements?<br>10. Finally they will ask u do u want to ask something from them? So if u hv some genuine ques to ask u may ask.<br><br>Statistics::<br>Overall 580 students appeared for written test.<br>Qualified for round 2::360<br>Qualified for round 3::195<br>Finally selected:90 students<br>B-Tech 86 from all branches and MCAs only four (coz only 17 appeared for written)<br><br><br><br><hr><p><font color="##FF0000">Following paper is provided by YuvaJobs.com .

After the ppt which was given at around 9.30am; the aptitude started. We were divided into two batches. The first batch started their apti at around 11am and the second batch at 1pm.<br><br> <br><br>Aptitude part:<br>It consisted of 3 sections:-<br>A) Verbal<br>It consisted of about 10 synonyms, 10 antonyms, followed by some questions on comprehension. For the synonyms and antonyms its better to go through Barrons 12th edition book.<br><br>B) Quantitative<br>It consisted of problems from the following topics: Time & distance, time & work, permutation & combinations, probability, numbers, equations, average, simple & compound interest, ratio & proportions, Venn diagrams, allegation of mixtures, etc For this part I would suggest all of you to go through the book by R.S. Agarwals Quantitative Aptitude. You must also go through previous years question papers to get problems of similar types. <br>C) Critical Reasoning <br>It consisted of passages from Barons 12th editions model test papers. My passages were:<br>Model Test 1, Sec 6, Q8-11<br>Model Test 3, Sec 5, Q1-4<br>Model Test 4, Sec 6, Q8-12<br><br> <br><br>Out of 216 students who appeared for the aptitude 170 students were selected for the interview.<br><br> <br><br>Technical and HR:<br>We were asked to fill in the blue form and then we were called  one by one for interview.My turn came at about 9.40pm. I entered the administrative block room. There were 10 panels each having 2 interviewers. I was led to panel no 5. There were 2 young persons sitting. I asked them May I come in. They nodded. Then I asked them May I sit. They told yes. I thanked them. Then started my interview.<br>MR: Have u studied Microprocessor in ur sem?<br>Me: Yes sir.<br>MR: Tell me how many pins are there in total?<br>Me: 40 pins.<br>MR: U r a student of electronics and communication engineering,  so define communication?<br>Me: Communication is the process of conveying or transferring messages from one point to another.    MR: Draw a circular Linked list?<br>Me: Drawn.<br>MR: Why TCS?<br>Me: Answered.<br>MR: What if I dont hire u?<br>Me: Answered.<br>MR: What r ur strengths?<br>Me: Answered. <br>MR: What r the qualities of a good leader?<br>Me: Answered.<br>MR: He gave me a situation where I was the captain of a ship which was beginning to sink in the middle of the sea. H e then asked me what I would do if there were not as many lifeboats to accommodate all the passengers.<br>Me: Answered.<br>MR: Do u have any questions?<br>Me: Yes sir what r the programming languages that I need to learn before joining TCS.<br>MR: He asked me in which field I wanted to go?<br>Me: I answered Java.<br>MR: So he told me to learn Advanced Java & J2EE.<br><br> <br><br>Then he shook hands with me.  I wished them Good Night. It was a brief 20mins interview and ended at 10pm.  The whole interview of our college ended at 11.30pm. We were all feeling very hungry so we went to our homes as early as possible. <br><br>  <br><br>The results were declared on 3rd Mar at about 4 pm.Of the 170 students 90 were selected. I had my name at no 48. It was a big moment of relief. Lots of congratulations were coming from both the friends and teachers. My parents were overjoyed. <br><br>  <br><br>One last tip I want to give to all of u:  If you r having a good academic background and is a good communicator in English, u r bound to get selected. And always be confident of what u are saying and practice apti well. <br><br><br><br><hr><p><font color="##FF0000">Following paper is provided by YuvaJobs.com .

I m giving here some important tips to prepare for TCS.<br><br> <br><br>As u might know that there are three rounds<br><br>1.Written<br><br>2.Techincal<br><br>3.HR<br><br> <br><br>Again Written contains following sections:-<br><br>1.Verbal: <br><br>10 Antonyms<br><br>10 Synonyms<br><br>For Antonyms refer barrons 12th edition Antonyms chapter pg no.126 and all the antonyms ques given in model test papers.<br><br>I got all the ques from these only.<br><br>For Synonyms refer the exercise given after the GRE high frequency word list.<br><br>Reading Comprehension & Sentence Completion:-For this prepare all passages given in the chapter for RC in barron n all passages from the model test paper.<br><br>I got the dilemma of fungus for sentence completion n the works of dozens of women writers n the passage abt Du Bois for rc<br><br> <br><br>2.Qunatitaive Aptitude: <br><br>Prepare the previous year ques most of them are same.Here I m giving only those ques which I felt where diff<br>1. The same matrix one in which u have to find the address of given element but in column wise manner.<br>2. if f(n)=f(n-1)*n and f(0)=1.find f(4)<br>Then there were ques on venn diag which same as previous year ques but I dont remember<br><br> <br><br>3.Critical Reasoning: <br><br>For this section just mug up all the ques given in the model test papers of barron 12th edtion. After clearing the written test u r called for tech interview.  Friends the trick to clear tech n hr is to be confident n always have a smiling face no matter how long u r waiting for chance<br><br>  <br><br>My tech was as follows:<br><br>1st they asked me tell abt urself.Then they asked microprocessors I have studied as I m from cs I had 8085 in my course.They asked me how many pins r there in 8085 n to draw its pin diag.As I was drawing it they interrupted me asked to draw the block diag of 8085.Then they asked some basic ques on it like what is sp(stack ptr)etc.Then they asked me to wap in assembly lang to swap data stored in two reg.<br><br>Then they asked me to wap two perform bubble sort n asked some basic ques frm that prog written in c.<br><br>They asked abt my training.There ques on dbms,os they asked me what we had studied in these subjs n asked ques according to my ans.<br><br>After this very soon I was called for hr round.<br><br>There was one sir one mam<br><br>1st of all mam asked me are u nervous?i said no.To this sir said she is nervous.Well then<br><br>Sir asked me to tell me abt urself then mam asked to tell abt my family background.<br><br>Then sir asked my strengths then asked ques on it.<br><br>He gave me situations to judge my sterngths n confidence.<br><br>Then he asked me basic qualities for a person to be successful.<br><br>He asked me the most important problem of my state n I was cm of my state how will I over come it.<br><br>Then he said he will ask one last ques from tech n asked abt data encapsulation.<br><br>He again asked me if m nervous.<br><br>Then mam asked me if I m ready to work anywhere<br><br>And then abt the bond n any ques if I want to ask.   <br><br>  <br><br>So this was my experience.Friends just be confident n always keeping praying bcoz God always listens n luck also matters a lot.I always thank god for my selection.<br><br><br><hr><p><font color="##FF0000">Following paper is provided by YuvaJobs.com .

Prepare C and C++ as per ur resume.they asked me differences between C and C++. Also I was asked to write a program on factorial. <br><br> 3.H.R.:Here  situations were given to me like on customer satisfaction.Basically they are checking ur confidence.why TCS ? why TCS should hire you? Strengths, weakness. <br><br>FEW POINTS: <br><br>1. Prepare ur resume wid utmost care. <br><br>2. Refer to papers on this site .These are really very beneficial. <br><br>3. Greet them well when u go for inter-view. <br><br>4. Keep smiling. <br><br>5. Eye-contact is very important. <br><br>6. Do not argue.Remember they know much more than u do.Be polite. <br><br>7. They will be very nice and will try keep u calm. <br><br>8. Do not give excuses.just BE CONFIDENT when u answer.Confidence is most important .Also be careful wid ur mobile phones.TCS looks 4 discipline.<br><br><br><br><hr><p><font color="##FF0000">Following paper is provided by YuvaJobs.com .

A and second as MR.B<br>me=may I come in sir?<br>MR. A =Yes come in<br>me=good evening sir<br>MR. A =have a seat<br>me=thank u sir<br>MR. A =so u r Mr Suvabrata Chatterjee right?<br>me=Yes sir<br>MR. A =so tell me about ur good qualities<br>me=explained...them I used the dynamic as one of them<br>MR. A =DYNAMIC ...what is dynamic<br>me: explained it<br>MR. A =so what r u bad qualities?<br>me=Sir I happened to believe lot of people which might end up in problems so I am looking forward to fix it<br>MR. A= ya I see, so u r an instrumentation student? Right?<br>me=yes sir.<br>MR. A=So why are u coming to IT sectors?<br>me=well sir I am an instrumentation engg so I have a graet knowledge in MICROPROCESSOR so with this knowledge I can serve IT sector better...most software run on a desired hard ware so with the good knowledge I can make things better<br>MR. A=ok....then tell me why should TCS hire u??<br>me=well as I said before I have a great knowledge in MICROPROCESSOR and good knowledge in PROGRAMMING moreover I am interested in REVERSE ENGINEERING(always put some unique thing)<br>MR. A=REVERSE ENGINEERING?? what is that?<br>me=well this is a method by which we can reverse the code ie the EXE file can be broken down to make the CODE visible<br>MR. A=how can it advantageous?<br>me=well I a group of programmer get detached from company or doesnt work anymore...with this method I can reverse to create the entire code he has generated in his mind it might be a useful f or this cases...<br>MR. A=is there any other way to get help?<br>me==might be but it seems to be more efficient...rather less resource consuming..<br>MR. A=good but..it...<br>me=well this can be considered as a HACKING but in an ETHICAL way<br>MR. A=so what r the basics u need to make a software rather how u r going to serve us.<br>me= firstly we need a good concept in programming...we need to make the TIME COMPLEXITY less and also theSPACE COMPLEXITY moreover we need to make the benchmarking for each test then add up the module to make the complete stuff...rather we also need to make ANTI-TAMPERING protection<br>MR. A=well well...<br>MR. B=well good...now what programming u know<br>me= sir I am confident in C language<br>MR. B= any other like C++ etc<br>me=no sir we dont have it in Sylbs but I am looking forwiord to it<br>MR. B=what the need of these other language<br>me=well its mostly PLATFORM INDEPENDENT eg JAVA...it might run in all system like LINUS SOLARIS WINDOWS etc<br>MR. B= can u draw a ANALOG and a DIGITAL signal<br>me= I did one is SINE wave another is PULSE<br>MR. B=which one is better?<br>me=DIGITAL signal<br>MR. B=why?<br>me=sir its lossless transmission<br>MR. B=what is lossless transmission<br>me=when we transmit any data it might be voice signal also...we transmit via analog or digital signal<br>MR. B=so what do u mean by AMPLITUDE MODULATION and FREQUENCY modulation<br>me=well when we transmitt any data it might be voice signal also we need a CARRIER rather putting it in laymans language what we get from from the microphones output is much less rather we cannot transmitt using induction coil generating electromagnetic waves<br><br>so we need a high source called carrier which is punched with the message signal ....now if the AMPLITUDE of the carrier gets changed with the message signal it called AMPLITUDE MODULATION and if the frequency gets changed its called FREQUECY MODULATION<br><br>MR. B=which one do u think is better?<br>me=it depends on where we are transmitting.....if we need to transmitt a long dist we need amplitude modulation but for crystality and clarity we need FREQUENCY modulation...<br>MR. B=well do u use MOBILE?<br>me=yes sir I do...<br>MR. B=so what the principle out there in MOBILE transmission?<br>me=MOBILE uses a MICROWAVE transmitting device and receiving device..<br>MR. B=well explain a bit...u had MOBILE COMMUNICATION right?<br>Me= no sir not yet I guess its in 7 th semester...well mobile uses a set of protocols like a GENRAL web page has....so...( he stopped me) MR.B=what is a microproceesor<br>me=explained<br>MR. B=what is interrupt?<br>me=explained<br>MR. B=what is flipflop?<br>me=one bit memory device in electronics concept multivibrator<br>MR. B=good..what is RS/KJ MASTER slave flip flop<br>me=explained all<br>MR. B=okay which part of C ur mostly dealing with?(//this is the tric part always say the srtrong area//)<br>me=ARRAY<br>MR. B=well what is an ARRAY<br>me=explined<br>MR. B=what is the limitation of array<br>me=explained<br>MR. B=so how do we overcome it<br>me=LINK LIST<br>me=explain the advantages of link list too<br>MR. B=can u reverse link list<br>me=explained<br>MR. B=OKAY...WRITE A PROGRAM IN C WHICH WILL DELETE ITSELF ON EXECUTION..<br>me==(thinking a bit...although it was the weirdest question I have ever been asked) well there is a SYSTEM function I know over there rather it can ACTIVATE the dos command behind C . .more clearly it link the C with DOS COMMAND PROMPT...so what if we write the DOS parameter over there I might delete the file we are executing....<br>MR.

Frnds.....This is Priyansh, E.C.E. from Narula Institute of Tech. Kolkata. We had our first campus drive on February,28th in the form of TCS. This was the first campus for 2009 pass-out batch and post-graduate students. We had to report at 8:30 sharp on the day. As the day had lot of surprise and mystery involved in it...we all wished that each of our friends get the job.<br><br>The recruiters arrived by 9,o clock. We had a Pre Placement Talk which lasted for about 2 hours. About 219 students sat for the test and 189 of us could finally crack the aptitude test.<br><br>Friends! It was an online exam and the question paper was average if u have groomed ur preparation as per the postings of students in Freshersworld.<br>There were 3 sections:<br>A>Verbal           <32 questions 20 mins.><br>B>Quantitave      < 38 questions 40 mins><br>C>Comprehension and critical reasoning <12 questions 30 mins.><br><br>THERE WAS NO NEGATIVE MARKING/SECTIONAL CUT_OFF<br><br>Verbal portion consisted of 10 synonyms 12 antonyms and 10 questions from RC (small paragraphs) It,s better to leave the preparation of synonyms and antonyms as they r always a tuf-nut. Give a wild guess to them.<br><br>Regarding Quantitave portion, i would say most of them were repeated and some had figures changed, but there were 90% common questions.Go through Fresherworlds site questions.<br><br>For the Comprehension portion , Barrons 12th edition can be considered as "GEETA".Mug up all the answers of Model Test 1-5,they will be just a repetition in the paper. At places some names r just changed.  "U can take my words for it"<br><br>Now regarding mah interview....It was a (technical+HR) round...My turn came at 8:30PM<br>I: Come in .<br>Me: Good Evning panel members(there were 2 of them)<br>Me: May i have a seat please?<br>I: Yes,please!<br>I: So, Priyansh! where r u from?<br>Me: Answered..<br>I: O! dat,s a lovely place ,isn,t it?<br>Me: Indeed,it is.<br>I: Describe urself.<br>Me: Answered<br>I: Which portion u r more prepared with..<br>Me: Comm. and Microprocessor(8085)and C<br>I: Asked all sorts of applied parts of Analog Electronics(AM,FM,Shannon  Hartley,application based 10 questions)<br>Me: Answered about 60% satisfactorily,say whatever u feel to say..confidently..they watch u every moment..<br>I: What is ur +ve point?<br>Me: Answered.<br>I: Asked some C questions...I answered<br>(He showed as if i was a duffer and knew nothing..but don,t go by dat..that,s also a test)<br>Hr: Describe a situation where u faced a challange in ur life?<br>Me: Answered.<br>Hr: Are u a team player?what about working in isolation ?<br>Me: Answered in the best possible way.<br>Hr: U r given a job which u won,t be able to do alone but then u hav to do it all by urself;what will be your approach?<br>Me: Answered<br>Hr: Are u mobile?<br>Me: Yes.<br>ok! thank u ..u may leave..I said thanks! and then left off!<br><br><br><br><hr><p><font color="##FF0000">Following paper is provided by YuvaJobs.com .

Tcs has fixed cutoff for whole written test it is not based on the high scorers. So as u complete the test ,the result will be displayed immediately and if u r selected then u r eligible for other rounds.<br><br>VERBAl SECTION::it consists of 10 Antonyms,10 synonyms and abt 10 to 12 ques based on passage reading.<br><br>SYNONYMS:<br>florid<br>mirage<br>furor<br>choleric<br>infirmity<br>pinnacle<br>voracious<br>slump<br>placate<br>expound<br><br>ANTONYMS:<br>lugubrious<br>retrospection<br>industry<br>mitigate<br>synergy<br>boorish<br>gamely<br>indigenous<br>fascinate<br>prostrate<br><br>(Actually these are the words which I got in my test paper, but I would advise not to waste ur time in learning English first coz no one can get more than two or three words, so dont worry for that just see all the words from previous papers.)<br><br>SECTION -2 (APTITUDE)<br>1) If log 0.317=0.3332 and log 0.318=0.3364 then find log 0.319 ?<br>Sol) log 0.317=0.3332 and log 0.318=0.3364, then<br>log 0.319=log0.318+(log(0.318-0.317)) = 0.3396<br><br>2)My flight takes of at 2am from a place at 18N 10E and landed 10 Hrs later at a place with coordinates 36N70W. What is the local time when my plane landed?<br>6:00 am b) 6:40am c) 7:40 d) 7:00 e) 8:00<br>Sol) The destination place is 80 degree west to the starting place. Hence the time difference between these two places is 5 hour 20 min. (=24hr*80/360).<br>When the flight landed, the time at the starting place is 12 noon (2 AM + 10 hours).<br>Hence, the time at the destination place is 12 noon - 5:20 hours = 6: 40 AM<br><br>3) what,s the answer for that :<br>A, B and C are 8 bit no,s. They are as follows:<br>A -> 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1<br>B -> 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1<br>C -> 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 ( - =minus, u=union)<br>Find ((A - C) u B) =?<br>To find A-C, We will find 2,s compliment of C and them add it with A,<br>That will give us (A-C)<br>2,s compliment of C=1,s compliment of C+1<br>=11000101+1=11000110<br>A-C=11000101+11000110<br>=10001001<br>Now (A-C) U B is .OR. logic operation on (A-C) and B<br>10001001 .OR . 00110011<br>The answer is = 10111011,<br>Whose decimal equivalent is 187.<br><br>4) In a two-dimensional array, X (9, 7), with each element occupying 4 bytes of memory, with the address of the first element X (1, 1) is 3000, find the address of X (8, 5).<br>Sol) initial x (1,1) = 3000 u hav to find from x(8,1)so u have x(1,1),x(1,2) ... x(7,7) = so u have totally 7 * 7 = 49 elementsu need to find for x(8,5) ? here we have 5 elements each element have 4 bytes : (49 + 5 -1) * 4 = 212 -----( -1 is to deduct the 1 element ) 3000 + 212 = 3212<br><br>5)The size of a program is N. And the memory occupied by the program is given by M = square root of 100N. If the size of the program is increased by 1% then how much memory now occupied ?<br>Sol) M=sqrt(100N)<br>N is increased by 1%<br>therefore new value of N=N + (N/100)<br>=101N/100<br>M=sqrt(100 * (101N/100) )<br>Hence, we get M=sqrt(101 * N)<br><br>6)In two dimensional array X(7,9) each element occupies 2 bytes of memory.If the address of first element X(1,1)is 1258 then what will be the address of the element X(5,8) ?<br>Sol) Here, the address of first element x[1][1] is 1258 and also 2 byte of memory is given. now, we have to solve the address of element x[5][8], therefore, 1258+ 5*8*2 = 1258+80 = 1338 so the answer is 1338.<br><br>7) The temperature at Mumbai is given by the function: -t2/6+4t+12 where t is the elapsed time since midnight.

No need to waste ur time and money in buying other books for TCS just go through Baron only ,all questions are from this book.<br><br>ROUND 2:<br>TECHNICAL INTERVIEW::<br><br>Be prepared for the technical interview. Mostly its on the same day after one hour.Prepare few of ur subjects very well like C,C++,DS,DBMS(specially queries),OS,COMP Networks,OOPs concepts etc.Hey friends dont be afraid, thay wil not ask u anything in depth they just check ur awareness and ask only some basic conceptual questions. They may ask abt ur fav subjects bt still they ask u abt DBMS n other subjects that u hv studied in earlier sem, so dont tell them the names of the subjects in which u dont hv good command. If u dont know anything abt the ques asked by them then dont try to make false stories or guesses, just simply deny that u dont know, and always try to divert them towards ur fav subjects. They will ask u abt ur project ,if u hv done any, so be prepared for it, its E R diagram, SRS,front end, back end,DFD,and overview of the project etc.Dont BE quiet, be talkative nd dont get embarrassed if u dont know the answer.be confident.i m attaching few most important ques of DBMS,SQL,C,C++ etc for TI , just go through them if u dont hv much time, it will be enough.So u people can download it or if u dont hv it just ask me on my e-mail(yusufkhan_mca@yahoo.co.in). <br><br>ROUND 3:<br>HR ROUND::<br><br>The key elements for this ROUND according to me are-CCT i.e. be Calm,be Confident(not over confident) and be Talkative. Basically they ask u all those ques that are typically asked in all interviews so be prepared for it ,readymade answers.Normally they check ur confident level, English speaking, and wat efforts u hv done before coming to face HR interview. Just go through the home page of TCS website and collect in formations abt them like::<br><br>Who is chairman, CEO, CFO, COO of TCS, BOARD of directors, Companys MISSION , VISION and VALUES, Target achieved by company during last few yrs, position of company in IT field etc.<br><br>Questions for HR(be prepared for atleast these ques)<br><br>1. Describe yourself??<br>2. ur hobbies(be prepared for this ques coz they will ask u much abt that ,if u say singing be prepare for a song,if u say joking be prepared to tell them a joke etc.)<br>3. Why u want to join TCS??<br>4. Where would u think urself after five years in TCS?<br>5. Why should I hire u??<br>6. they may ask u something abt tcs?its statistics, CEo,CFO etc.<br>7. whats ur fav time pass??<br>8. ur strength ,ur weakness (dont tel them any grt weaknes of urs like if u hv less communication skills, etc)<br>9. Do u have any role model?? Describe his/her achievements?<br>10. Finally they will ask u do u want to ask something from them? So if u hv some genuine ques to ask u may ask.<br><br>Statistics::<br><br>Overall 580 students appeared for written test.<br>Qualified for round 2::360<br>Qualified for round 3::195<br><br>Finally selected:90 students<br>B-Tech 86 from all branches and MCAs only four (coz only 17 appeared for written)<br><br>Finally result was announced on 11th march 08 at 12:30 a.m. and I was selected.<br>So all the best n meet u in TCS.<br><br><br><br><hr><p><font color="##FF0000">Following paper is provided by YuvaJobs.com .

After the ppt which was given at around 9.30am; the aptitude started. We were divided into two batches. The first batch started their apti at around 11am and the second batch at 1pm.<br><br>Aptitude part:<br>It consisted of 3 sections:-<br>A) Verbal<br>It consisted of about 10 synonyms, 10 antonyms, followed by some questions on comprehension. For the synonyms and antonyms its better to go through Barrons 12th edition book.<br><br>B) Quantitative<br>It consisted of problems from the following topics: Time & distance, time & work, permutation & combinations, probability, numbers, equations, average, simple & compound interest, ratio & proportions, Venn diagrams, allegation of mixtures, etc For this part I would suggest all of you to go through the book by R.S. Agarwals Quantitative Aptitude. You must also go through previous years question papers to get problems of similar types.<br>C) Critical Reasoning<br>It consisted of passages from Barons 12th editions model test papers. My passages were:<br>Model Test 1, Sec 6, Q8-11<br>Model Test 3, Sec 5, Q1-4<br>Model Test 4, Sec 6, Q8-12<br><br>Out of 216 students who appeared for the aptitude 170 students were selected for the interview.<br><br>Technical and HR:<br>We were asked to fill in the blue form and then we were called one by one for interview.My turn came at about 9.40pm. I entered the administrative block room. There were 10 panels each having 2 interviewers. I was led to panel no 5. There were 2 young persons sitting. I asked them May I come in. They nodded. Then I asked them May I sit. They told yes. I thanked them. Then started my interview.<br>MR: Have u studied Microprocessor in ur sem?<br>Me: Yes sir.<br>MR: Tell me how many pins are there in total?<br>Me: 40 pins.<br>MR: U r a student of electronics and communication engineering, so define communication?<br>Me: Communication is the process of conveying or transferring messages from one point to another. MR: Draw a circular Linked list?<br>Me: Drawn.<br>MR: Why TCS?<br>Me: Answered.<br>MR: What if I dont hire u?<br>Me: Answered.<br>MR: What r ur strengths?<br>Me: Answered.<br>MR: What r the qualities of a good leader?<br>Me: Answered.<br>MR: He gave me a situation where I was the captain of a ship which was beginning to sink in the middle of the sea. H e then asked me what I would do if there were not as many lifeboats to accommodate all the passengers.<br>Me: Answered.<br>MR: Do u have any questions?<br>Me: Yes sir what r the programming languages that I need to learn before joining TCS.<br>MR: He asked me in which field I wanted to go?<br>Me: I answered Java.<br>MR: So he told me to learn Advanced Java & J2EE.<br><br>Then he shook hands with me. I wished them Good Night. It was a brief 20mins interview and ended at 10pm. The whole interview of our college ended at 11.30pm. We were all feeling very hungry so we went to our homes as early as possible.<br><br>The results were declared on 3rd Mar at about 4 pm.Of the 170 students 90 were selected. I had my name at no 48. It was a big moment of relief. Lots of congratulations were coming from both the friends and teachers. My parents were overjoyed.<br><br>One last tip I want to give to all of u: If you r having a good academic background and is a good communicator in English, u r bound to get selected. And always be confident of what u are saying and practice apti well.<br><br><br><br><hr><p><font color="##FF0000">Following paper is provided by YuvaJobs.com .

Vocabulary section<BR>2. Quantitative section<BR>3. analytical reasoning section<BR>&nbsp;<BR>The test is either Online or Offline, if it is online then paper is somewhat easy but u have time limit to solve any of the section though u can scroll through ques. in that section. that is u have to complete 1st section in time limit given to u. this results in that the last section is somewhat easy and completes in less time but u cant solve ur ques. remaining in 1st section. thios is disadvantage of it. but if test is Offline then paper is hard whole paper(all three sections) is given to you and u have to solve it in 90 minutes no matter that u are scrolling through sections or not.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>1st section consist of 10 synonyms and 10 antonyms, paragraph complition and ques. from given para..<BR>the words are bit hard and meerly 1 or 2 are from privious TCS paper (remember this coz we generally depend on it)</P>
<P>I recall in my paper only two words i. e. ,rubbish, and ,controvert, were from previous paper and words like ,Mirrage, etc. were asked for 1st time.<BR>&nbsp;For these words go through GRE Barrons word list. u will get it easy if u are gone through book , word power made easy , by Norman Lewis.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>2nd section consists of very less aptitude ques. from R.S. Agrawal and maximum ques. are based on 10 and 12 std. maths i.e. ques. on parabola ellipes, matrices etc.but this section is easy and u can easily crack it with some basic knowledge of maths. </P>
<P>&nbsp;<BR>3rd section is analytical reasoning in which ques. on puzzles, logical diagrams, etc. are included. its is most easy section.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>ur result is displayed on screen as u complete test in Online test.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>as u shortlist in test u have to undergo technical intervierw 1st and after passing it u have to go for HR.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>technical interview is not so difficult only u should be confident in it. as u passed aptitude test its very easy to get in TCS though u are not so strong in technical only the fact is u should be confident and fluent in english. also remember that HR is also elimination round in TCS so be prepared for it. answer with care in HR, generally the ques. like <BR>1 Why should I hire u TCS ?<BR>2 why do u want to join TCS?<BR>3 what u are having different than others that I select u?<BR>&nbsp;also qus. like ur achievements in past, ur goal in life.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>In my college 290 students were eligible for TCS out of which 37 were shortlisted for T.I. and from this 18 were for HR and finally they select 15 students.</P><br><br><hr><p><font color="##FF0000">Following paper is provided by YuvaJobs.com .
